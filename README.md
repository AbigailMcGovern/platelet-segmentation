# platelet-segmentation
Deep-learning-based segmentation for confocal platelet image data. Data was produced by Pia Larsson (Monash).

## Current
Currently contains in-progress U-net for segmentation of confocal platelet data. U-net is designed to accomodate anisotropic data. Our data is 3D + t with dimensions z:33, y:512, x:512. 

## Plans
